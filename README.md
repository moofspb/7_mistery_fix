# Quadratic Equations Solver

The module quadratic_equation.py includes function get_roots that takes args a, b, c and returns roots of quadratic equation.

The arguments a, b, and c are the coefficients of the equation.
 
# Usage

```#!bash

from quadratic_equation import get_roots
roots = get_roots(1, 3, -4)
roots
(-4.0, 1.0)

```

# Tests

Also, there is module tests.py that contains unit tests. You can run it by typing:

```#!bash

$ python tests.py
